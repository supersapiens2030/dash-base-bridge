# DashBase Bridge – wDASH on Base

**Open-source non-custodial bridge** bringing Dash (175 k daily InstantSend transactions) to Base DeFi (Aerodrome, Uniswap).

## Goal
- Mint/burn wDASH on Base (EVM)
- Target: **$5 M+ TVL** in 3 months (same playbook as Zolana Bridge: $56 M TVL on Solana)
- 100 % open-source (MIT), governed by Dash masternodes

## Why Base?
- Coinbase onboarding + EVM compatibility = fastest path to millions of real users
- Aerodrome already dominates Base volume → perfect for wDASH/USDC pools
- Wormhole + Base Superbridge SDK ready

## Milestones
1. Testnet bridge (Base Sepolia + Dash testnet)
2. Mainnet launch + Aerodrome pool seeding
3. Community governance hand-off

## Status – Nov 2025
- Base Builder Grant nominated (5 ETH requested)
- Repo live → ready for contributions
